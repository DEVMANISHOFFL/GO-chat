Love it—no code, just sharp planning. Here’s a clean, prioritized menu of production-grade features, with why they matter and what they’d touch. Pick a path and we’ll lock the scope next.

# 🔝 Quick Wins (High impact, Medium effort)

1. Reactions (👍 ❤️ 😂)

* Why: Lightweight engagement, reduces “+1” noise.
* Backend: Store `reaction` counts per message; WS events: `reaction.add`/`reaction.remove`.
* Frontend: Reaction bar on hover/long-press; per-user reaction state.
* Dependencies: Stable message IDs.

2. Edit & Delete (with “edited” badge, soft-delete)

* Why: Fix typos; comply with user expectations.
* Backend: `message.edit`, `message.delete` events; keep `edited_at`, `deleted=true`.
* Frontend: Inline editor, contextual menu, tombstone UI.
* Guardrails: Time window for edits (e.g., 15 min) optional.

3. Read Receipts & Delivery States

* Why: Adds trust (“sent / delivered / seen”).
* Backend: Track per-user read cursor per room; WS: `read.cursor.update`.
* Frontend: Per-message tick marks; room “unread until” divider.

4. File & Image Uploads (images first)

* Why: Core modern chat behavior.
* Backend: S3/GCS presigned upload; virus check hook optional.
* Frontend: Drag/drop, paste, preview, thumbnail viewer; size/type caps.

5. Search v1 (room + global, text-only)

* Why: Retrieval is table stakes.
* Backend: Secondary index or lightweight FTS (Bleve/Meili optional later).
* Frontend: Search box + result list; highlight matches.

# 🧭 Core UX Polish (Medium impact, Low–Medium effort)

6. Mentions & Autocomplete (@user)

* Why: Improves multi-user convos.
* Backend: Notify mentioned user; optional index for mention search.
* Frontend: Typeahead in composer; highlight in bubbles.

7. Message Pinning & Bookmarks

* Why: Keeps key info accessible.
* Backend: `pinned_messages` per room.
* Frontend: Pin icon, room pins panel.

8. Link Previews (Open Graph)

* Why: Richer messages, fewer clicks.
* Backend: Server-side unfurl microservice (with caching).
* Frontend: Compact preview card.

9. Drafts & Multi-line Composer

* Why: Reduce lost work; better writing.
* Frontend only: Local storage drafts per room; shift+enter for newline.

# 👥 Presence, Rooms, & Invites (Foundational)

10. Robust Presence & “Last Seen”

* Why: Social proof, trust.
* Backend: Heartbeat pings; expiry; “away/online/offline.”
* Frontend: Presence dots, tooltips.

11. Room Management (DMs, groups, invites)

* Why: Growth & organization.
* Backend: Room roles (owner/admin/member); invite links; joins/leaves.
* Frontend: Create room modal, members panel, role badges.

# 🛡️ Safety, Moderation & Compliance

12. Roles & Permissions (RBAC)

* Why: Control over moderation features.
* Backend: Role table & checks; audit log.
* Frontend: Permission-gated actions.

13. Rate Limiting & Spam Controls

* Why: Protect infra & UX.
* Backend: Token bucket per user/IP/room; flood detection.
* Frontend: Gentle toasts, cooldown UI.

14. Reporting & Admin Tools

* Why: Resolve abuse, debug.
* Backend: Reports queue; admin actions; audit trails.
* Frontend: Admin dashboard, filters.

# 🚀 Performance & Reliability

15. Infinite Pagination + Jump to Unread (polish)

* Why: Fast load; keeps context intact.
* Backend: Keyset pagination; backfill.
* Frontend: “New messages” divider (you have), refine scroll heuristics.

16. Reconnect & De-dup Logic

* Why: Mobile/weak networks resilience.
* Backend: Idempotent message IDs; missed-event replay window.
* Frontend: Buffer while offline; dedupe by ID.

# 🌍 Quality & Growth

17. i18n & RTL readiness

* Why: Global audience.
* Frontend: Locale packs; date/time formatting; RTL utilities.

18. Accessibility (A11y) pass

* Why: Inclusive + better UX.
* Frontend: Roles, labels, focus traps, keyboard shortcuts.

19. Notifications (web push + email digests)

* Why: Retention.
* Backend: Web Push service; digest cron.
* Frontend: Permission flow; per-room notification settings.

# 🧪 Engineering Excellence

20. Observability (logs, metrics, traces)

* Why: Diagnose prod quickly.
* Backend: Structured logs, Prometheus metrics; traces around WS.
* SLOs: connect success rate, message latency, error budget.

21. CI/CD & Preview Environments

* Why: Safe iteration.
* Pipelines: tests, lint, typecheck, e2e smoke; PR previews.

If you want, I can turn any subset above into a precise acceptance-criteria checklist (no code) so you can assign tasks and review outcomes. Which 3–5 do you want to lock first?
